# FoamFactions
This is an Early start on an app meant for the Nerf community. Being my first full project using Swift, it might be a little rough around the edges :smile:. I am using Storyboards, Xibs, and programmatically created views using SnapKit to explore all Swift has to offer. Parse is used as a temporary way to host the app data and requests.
